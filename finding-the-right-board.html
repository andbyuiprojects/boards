      <h2 class="page2-headline-1">Where Do I Start?</h2>
        <p class="page2-paragraph-1">Determining which board is for you can be difficult, we recommend that any new rider starts out with our base line models, for skim boarders, that would be some of our more basic, wide models, for bodyboarders, our 50/50 rail boards with EPS cores, and for surfers, our 7-9 foot and up foamies.</p>

      <h2 class="page2-headline-2">Intermedeate Riders</h2>
        <p class="page2-paragraph-2">For more intermediate riders in skimboarding we would recommend checking out our higher performance carbon epoxy blend boards, and trying out some new shapes, like our narrower shapes for getting out to the waves faster. For our bodyboarders we recommend looking into some of our higher performance boards we recommend looking at our channeled boards with both 50\50 rail or 40\60, and also looking at some contours. For our surfers, we recommend getting into the 5-6 foot fommies and some 6 foot carbon boards.</p>
      <h2 class="page2-headline-3">Advanced Riders</h2>
        <p class="page2-paragraph-3">For the advanced and competition riders in skimboarding we would recommend our double carbon fiber epoxy boards. We would also recommend looking at other shapes then the pin tail, such as our swallow tail, to give you that extra bite into the wave on your wraps. We would also recommend getting a thinner board to add to the responsive ness of the board. For bodyboarders, we recommend a dual core board, with 40\60 rails and channels. We would also recommend for smaller waves, a bat tail, and for larger a crescent tail. And for our surfers, we would recommend a carbon board in the 5-6 foot range, with either a 2+1, thruster, or quad fin setup. We would also recommend that you go with a more streamline nose design to help drive down the line, to get barreled or get the big air you have been dreaming of.</p>
